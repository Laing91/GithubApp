This app is built using the Github API to fetch user values and display them on the browser using the JavaScript DOM.

Simply search for a Github profile and hit Get Info!

There are a few values that will be displayed here, such as the Github users name, their profile name, their avatar/profile image, how many public repositories they currently have, and what their github page link is.

If the Github user doesn't exist, nothing will change on the screen, however you will notice it being caught in the console, as it should display an error.
























# GithubApp
Web App using Github API

# Programming Assessment
## Project Brief

[Github](https://github.com/) is the largest source code management platform in the world, and you are tasked with using its public API to create a small web app that will allow a user to search for a username and preview a summary of the matched users profile.

## Project Requirements
- Provide a simple web application that can provide the neccesary functionality to the user.
- Makes use of Githubs [public api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api) to search for and retrieve a users public profile information.
- Displays a clear summary of the users profile including;
    - Users Name
    - Profile Image
    - Link to Profile
    - Number of public repositories
- Alongside the summary the app *may* provide a link to the users github repositories _or_ load the list of repositories on within the app. 
- The app *must* handle errors gracefully.

## Technical Requirements
- The app *must* make use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Deliver the UI.
- The app *may* utilise server side technology to deliver the app. (Python, Java, PHP, C#, Ruby, etc...)
- Authentication with the Github API is not required because 60 requests per hour will be sufficient.

## Additional Notes
- This task should take between 2 and 4 hours.
- The Solution should be delivered in a ZIP file to `david@vintagetravel.co.uk`
- The Solution should contain a brief `readme` file with instructions on running the app.
- You *may* use client side or serverside frameworks. If used please include all neccessary files from the framework in your solution.
- If you make use of in full, or in part, another developers work from github, stackoverflow or any other location please add a citation in the code so we can discern between contributed and original work.

Good Luck.
